You can find the code to build the bots in the **Code** directory and the instructions to follow in the **docs** directory. I will add more as I continue my journey and adapt the code that has come from wiser people before me into something that makes sense to my brain.

If you find there is a way to make my instructions more explicitly clear, whilst remaining as simple as possible (let's keep it pythonic people), feel free to submit a pull request.

I'll also add links to resources that I have found useful.
